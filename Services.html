<li><strong>Disease Diagnosis:</strong> Nephrology hospitals offer comprehensive diagnostic services to identify kidney diseases and disorders. This may include blood tests, urine tests, imaging studies (such as ultrasound or CT scan), and kidney biopsy if necessary.</li>

<li><strong>Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) Management:</strong> Nephrologists in these hospitals provide specialized care for patients with chronic kidney disease. They assess the stage of CKD, develop treatment plans, and monitor disease progression. This may involve lifestyle modifications, medication management, and regular follow-up visits.</li>

<li><strong>Acute Kidney Injury (AKI) Treatment:</strong> Nephrology hospitals are equipped to handle cases of acute kidney injury, a sudden and temporary loss of kidney function. They provide critical care interventions, such as fluid management, medication adjustments, and renal replacement therapy (dialysis) if needed.</li>

<li><strong>Hemodialysis and Peritoneal Dialysis:</strong> Nephrology hospitals often have dedicated dialysis units where patients with kidney failure can undergo hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. These procedures help remove waste products and excess fluids from the blood when the kidneys are unable to perform this function adequately.</li>

<li><strong>Kidney Transplantation:</strong> Nephrology hospitals may have transplant programs where they perform kidney transplant surgeries. They evaluate potential recipients and donors, carry out the transplant procedure, and provide post-transplant care, including immunosuppressive medication management.</li>

<li><strong>Hypertension (High Blood Pressure) Management:</strong> Nephrologists also specialize in the management of hypertension, a common condition that can cause kidney damage. They work to control blood pressure through lifestyle modifications and medication to prevent further kidney damage.</li>

<li><strong>Electrolyte and Acid-Base Disorders:</strong> Nephrology hospitals provide diagnosis and treatment for disorders related to electrolyte imbalances (e.g., sodium, potassium) and acid-base disturbances. They assess the underlying cause and prescribe appropriate interventions.

<li><strong>Kidney Stone Management:</strong> Nephrology hospitals offer services for the diagnosis and treatment of kidney stones. This may include diagnostic imaging, medication to manage pain and promote stone passage, or procedures such as extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) or ureteroscopy to remove or break up larger stones.</li>

<li><strong>Genetic and Congenital Kidney Diseases:</strong> Nephrologists in specialized hospitals also diagnose and manage genetic and congenital kidney disorders. They provide genetic counseling, assess disease progression, and develop treatment plans tailored to individual patients.</li>

<li><strong>Patient Education and Support:</strong> Nephrology hospitals often provide patient education programs to help individuals and their families understand kidney disease, treatment options, and lifestyle modifications. They may also offer support services, such as counseling or support groups, to help patients cope with the challenges of living with kidney disease.</li>
